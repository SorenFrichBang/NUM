# Solow Model with Human Capital

Our project is titled The Solow model with human capital and is about the impact of savings of human capital on production. The primary focus of the project is the effect of a rise in the savings rate of human capital on the steady states values of the model, as well as an introduction of a tax on physical capital and allocation of tax revenue towards human capital.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on a analytical and numerical solution of the Solow model with human capital, which considers the accumulation of both physical and human capital, along with technological progress, to determine the output per effective worker. By analyzing the effects of varying human capital savings rates on steady state values, the project aims to gain insights into the long-term growth and development of an economy.

## Key Features
- Analytical Solution of the Solow model with human capital
- Simulate the Solow model with human capital
- Explore the impact of savings rate of human capital on steady state values
- Introduce a tax on physical capital and analyze its effects on the model
- Allocate tax revenue towards human capital and evaluate the consequences

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/projects-2023-mathias-emma-S-ren`
2. Install the required dependencies: 
3. Run the main script: `modelproject.ipynb`
4. Unfortunately, Github does not execute ineractive widgets, which means that the interactive sliders and plots will not be displayed on Gitubs code viewer, 
   you therefore need to run it in VScode. 

## Usage

- Adjust the parameters in the code to explore different scenarios and model configurations.
- Observe the generated output, including graphs and numerical results, to analyze the impact of human capital savings and tax allocation on the Solow model.

## Conclusion

The Solow model with human capital provides valuable insights into the relationship between savings of human capital and production. By examining the effects of varying savings rates and tax allocations, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of long-term economic growth and the optimization of resource allocation for sustainable development.
